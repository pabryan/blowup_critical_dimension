\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

We consider the phenomena of \emph{blow up} for solutions of the problem,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:pde}
\begin{cases}
\partial_t \psi &= \psi_{rr} + \frac{C}{r} \psi_r - \frac{1}{r^2} F(\psi) \\
\psi(r, 0) &= \psi_0(r) \\
\psi(0, t) &= 0, \quad \psi(1, t) = \psi_1, \quad t \in [0, T)
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
where \(C > 0\) is a real constant and \(F\) is an odd \(C^{1,\alpha}\) function on \((-a, a)\) for some \(a \in (0, \infty]\) that is increasing on an interval \((-\delta, \delta)\) around \(0\). Note that \(F(0) = 0\) and \(F'(0) > 0\). When \(a < \infty\) we also assume that \(F(a) = 0\), \(F(z) = A z +  \bigo(z^{1+\alpha})\) as \(z \to a\) and \(\int_0^a F(z) dz = 0\).

Such problems arise in studying equivariant \emph{harmonic map heat flow} and equivariant \emph{Yang-Mills flow}. Let \(u\) solve
\[
\begin{cases}
\frac{1}{2} (u^2)' &= F(u) \\
u(0) &= 0.
\end{cases}
\]
so that \(F(\psi) = u(\psi) u'(\psi)\) and
\[
u(z) = \sqrt{\abs{\int_0^z F(w) dw}}.
\]
The conditions \(F > 0\), \(F(0) = 0\), \(F \in C^{1\,\alpha}\) and \(F'(0) > 0\) ensure that \(u\) is at least \(C^{1,\alpha/2}\).

Define the Riemmanian warped-product manifold \((M, g)\) by
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:warped_product}
M = (0, a) \times \S^1, \quad g = dz^2 + u^2(z) d\theta^2.
\end{equation}

Going the other way, given \(u\) defining \(g\) we recover \(F(\psi) = u(\psi) u'(\psi)\). Either way, equation \eqref{eq:pde}  with \(C = 1\) is precisely the \emph{degree one, equivariant harmonic map heat flow} of maps \(\Psi: (B^2, \delta) \to (M, g)\) where \(\delta\) is the flat metric. Here degree one, equivariant means that \(\Psi\) is of the form, \(\Psi(re^{i\theta}) = (\psi(r), \theta)\). Higher degree maps, i.e. those of the form \(\Psi(re^{i\theta}) = (\psi(r), \ell \theta)\) may also be treated - they simply result in \(F \mapsto \ell^2 F\) and here we absorb the \(\ell^2\) factor into \(F\).

One can also formulate the higher dimensional analogue, with \(g = dz^2 + u^2 g_{\S^{n-1}}\) where \(g_{\S^{n-1}}\) is the round metric on \(\S^{n-1}\). In this case, \(C = n-1\).

Let us also remark that if \(F'(0) = 1\), the metric \(g\) extends to a \(C^{1,\alpha/2}\) metric on the open disc \(D(a)\) of radius \(a\) with \(r = 0\) corresponding to the centre of the disc. Similarly for \(F'(a) = -1\) (for \(a < \infty\)). If both conditions hold, the metric extends to a metric on \(\S^2\). If either condition fails, then we still obtain a metric on \(\S^2\) but with a conical singularity at the point(s) corresponding to \(r=0, a\).

Here are two motivating examples described in \cite{MR2332425}.

\begin{example}
Let \(u = \sin(\psi)\). Then degree one harmonic map heat flow gives \(F = \tfrac{1}{2} \sin(2\psi)\) and \((M, g)\) is the round two-sphere. Degree \(\ell\) harmonic map heat flow gives \(F = \tfrac{\ell^2}{2} \sin(2\psi)\).Higher dimensional, equivariant harmonic maps \(B^n \to \S^n\) with equivariant \(\SO(n-1)\) symmetries gives rise to \(C = n-1\), \(F = \tfrac{n-1}{2} \sin(2\psi)\).
\end{example}

\begin{example}
The \(\SO(4)\) equivariant Yang-Mills flow on \(\R^4\) gives rise to \(C = 1\), \(F = 4 \psi(1 - \psi)(1 - \tfrac{1}{2}\psi)\). The higher dimensional (\(\SO(n)\) equivariant on \(\R^n\)) analogue is \(C = n-3\), \(F = 2(n-2) \psi(1-\psi)(1 - \tfrac{1}{2}\psi)\).
\end{example}

Here we are motivated by generalising some interesting properties of these two examples observed in \cite{MR2332425}. These observations are that in either example, the critical dimension (\(n=2\) for harmonic maps, \(n=4\) for Yang-Mills) in which the problems are conformally invariant gives \(C = 1\) and finite time blow up for the harmonic map heat flows (first proven in \cite{MR1180392}) and no finite time blow up for the Yang-Mills flow (first proven in \cite{MR1600272}). The curious point is that for Yang-Mills flow, the metric \(g\) has a conical singularity but no blow up, whereas for the harmonic map heat flow, the metric is smooth and we do have blow up. Evidently, it is not the conical singularity that determines blow up. The answer given is that the coefficient \(\ell^2 = 1\) for harmonic map heat flow, and \(\ell^2 = 4\) for Yang-Mills flow determines blow up.

For us this translates to letting \(\ell^2 = F'(0)\). In other words, blow up is determined by the \emph{linearisation of \(F\) about \(\psi \equiv 0\)}. Let us define,
\[
\bar{F} (\psi) = F(\psi) - F'(0) \psi
\]
and the linear operator,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:L}
L(\psi) = \psi_{rr} + \frac{C}{r} \psi_r - \frac{1}{r^2} F'(0) \psi
\end{equation}
so that the harmonic map heat flow, equation \eqref{eq:pde} becomes
\begin{equation}
\partial_t \psi - L(\psi) = - \frac{1}{r^2} \bar{F}(\psi).
\end{equation}

The operator \(L\) is an Euler operator with \emph{characteristic equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:char_eqn}
p(\beta) = \beta^2 + (C-1) \beta - F'(0) = 0.
\end{equation}
The discriminant is
\[
\Delta = (C-1)^2 + 4 F'(0) > 0,
\]
so we always have real, distinct roots
\[
\frac{1 - C}{2} \pm \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{(C-1)^2 + 4 F'(0)}.
\]
Notice that since \(F'(0) > 0\), we have
\[
\frac{1}{2} \sqrt{(C-1)^2 + 4 F'(0)} > \left|\frac{1-C}{2}\right|
\]
and hence one root is positive while the other is negative. Solutions of \(L(\psi) = 0\) are of the form \(\psi(r) = r^{\beta^{\pm}}\) where \(\beta^{\pm}\) are the roots of the characteristic equation \eqref{eq:char_eqn}. The negative root is of no interest since \(r^{\beta_-}\) blows up at \(r = 0\). For the positive root, \(r^{\beta_+}\) equals \(0\) at \(r = 0\) and has finite first derivative precisely when \(r^{\beta_+} \geq 1\).

This behaviour carries over to the flow \eqref{eq:pde} as described by main theorems.

\begin{mainthm}[Finite time blow up for \(C = 1\)]
\label{thm:mainC1}
Let \(\psi\) be a finite energy solution of the harmonic map heat flow equation \eqref{eq:pde} with \(C = 1\). Then \(\psi\) has \(C^1\) blow up in finite time if \(\beta_+ = 1\). If \(\beta_+ > 1\), the boundary condition satisfies \(\psi_1 \in (0, 2a)\) and the initial condition satisfies \(\psi_0(r) = \bigo(r^{\beta_+})\) as \(r\to 0\), then finite time blow up does not occur.
\end{mainthm}

\begin{mainthm}[Finite time blow up for general \(C\)]
\label{thm:mainC}
Let \(\psi\) be a finite energy solution of the harmonic map heat flow equation \eqref{eq:pde} with arbitrary \(C\). {\color{red}Then blow up seems to be determined by \(\beta_+\) and \(\beta_-\) and perhaps also \(\bar{F}\)}.
\end{mainthm}

\begin{rem}
\label{rem:char_eqn_C1}
We recover the results of \cite{MR2332425} by observing that when \(C = 1\), the characteristic equation becomes
\[
p(\beta) = \beta^2 - F'(0)
\]
with roots \(\beta_{\pm} = \pm \sqrt{F'(0)}\). Degree one harmonic map heat flow has \(\beta_+ = 1\) and blow up occurs. More generally, degree \(\ell\) harmonic map heat flow has \(\beta_+ = \ell\) which does not blow up for \(\ell \geq 2\) and finally, Yang-Mills has \(\beta_+ = 2\) once more without blow up.
\end{rem}

Our interpretation is that the harmonic map heat flow, equation \eqref{eq:pde} is the harmonic map heat flow from a flat disc \(D^2\) into a warped product that is also invariant under the action of \(\S^1\) on both source and target. The coefficients \(1/r, 1/r^2\) are singular precisely at the fixed point \(r = 0\) and standard parabolic estimates (see \Cref{lem:apriori_bounds} below) ensure that blow up, if it occurs at all, must occur around this fixed point. Note that the other fixed point of \(\S^2\) (i.e. \(r=a\)) behaves qualitatively different as there is no corresponding fixed point of \(D^2\), but does feature in the theorems through the \(a\) dependence of the \(L_{\infty}\) bounds. The reason the linearised operator \(L\) determines blow up is because \(F'(0)\) dominates as \(\psi \to 0\) which occurs as \(r \to 0\) via the boundary condition \(\psi(0) = 0\); that is via the condition that this point is fixed under the action of \(\S^1\) on both source and target.


The method of proof - as used by many authors \cite{MR2332425,MR1180392} - proceeds by suitable construction of sub and super solutions either forcing or preventing blow up. These are obtained from one-parameter families of stationary solutions \(\xi = \xi_{\lambda}\) satisfying \(L(\xi) = -\tfrac{1}{r^2} \bar{F} (\xi)\) and \(\xi(0) = 0\). Since \(L\) is second order, this leaves the free parameter \(\lambda\) specifying \(\xi'(0)\). By allowing this parameter to depend on \(t\) in just the right way, we obtain the desired sub and super solutions, \(\xi_{\lambda(t)} (r)\). Blow up then occurs (or not) according to the variation of \(\xi\) with respect to \(\lambda\) and whether \(\lambda\) blows up in finite time or not.


\section{Energy and Gradient Flow}
\label{subsec:intro_energygradient}

It is standard that both the harmonic map heat flow and Yang-Mills flow are the gradient flow for Dirichlet energies,
\[
E(\Psi) = \frac{1}{2} \int_M \|\nabla \Psi\|^2 d\mu
\]
where \(\|\cdot\|\) and \(\nabla\) are suitably interpreted. Thus our equation \eqref{eq:pde} should be the gradient flow of energy amongst equivariant solutions. Let us record here the simple statement of this fact and make some basic observations about finite energy solutions.

\begin{defn}
\label{defn:energy}
The energy, \(\E(\psi)\) of a map \(\psi: [0, 1] \to \R\) is defined to be
\[
\E(\psi) = \frac{1}{2} \int_0^1 \left(\psi_r^2 + \frac{1}{r^2} u^2(\psi)\right) r^C dr.
\]
\end{defn}

\begin{lemma}
The equation \eqref{eq:pde} is the negative \(L^2\) gradient flow with respect to the weighted measure \(r^C dr\) for the energy \(\E\) defined in Definition \ref{defn:energy}.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let \(\psi(r, t)\) be a compactly supported smooth one-parameter family of smooth maps \(r \mapsto \psi(r, t)\).

Then we compute
\[
\begin{split}
\partial_t \E(\psi) &= \partial_t \frac{1}{2} \int_0^1  \left(\psi_r^2 + \frac{1}{r^2} u^2(\psi)\right) r^C dr \\
&= \int_0^1  \left(\psi_r \psi_{rt} + \frac{1}{r^2} u(\psi)u'(\psi) \psi_t \right) r^C dr \\
&= \int_0^1 \left((\psi_r \psi_t r^C)_r - \psi_{rr} \psi_t r^C - C r^{C-1} \psi_r \psi_t + \frac{1}{r^2} F(\psi) \psi_t r^C\right) dr \\
&= - \int_0^1 \left(\psi_{rr} + \frac{C}{r} \psi_r - \frac{1}{r^2} F(\psi)\right) \psi_t r^C dr.
\end{split}
\]
\end{proof}

\begin{rem}
\label{rem:finite_energy}

Finite energy functions \(\psi\) must satisfy
\[
\int_0^1 \psi_r^2 r^C dr < \infty \text{ and } \int_0^1 u^2(\psi(r)) r^{C-2} dr < \infty
\]
First, as \(r\to 0\), \(\psi_r\) must not blow up faster than \(1/r\). Next noting that the assumptions on \(F\) imply \(F(z) = F'(0) z + \bigo(z^{1+\alpha})\) and hence
\[
u^2(z) = \int F(z) dz = \frac{F'(0))}{2} z^2 + \bigo(z^{2+\alpha}).
\]
Thus finite energy solutions satisfy for any \(\rho \in (0, 1)\),
\[
\int_0^{\rho} \psi(r)^2 r^{C-2} dr < \infty
\]
and hence
\[
\psi(r) = \bigo\left(r^{1 + \tfrac{1-C}{2}}\right)
\]
as \(r \to 0\). In particular, for \(C = 1\).
\[
\psi(r) = \bigo(r)
\]
as \(r \to 0\).
\end{rem}

\section{Stationary solutions}
\label{sec:stationary}

In this section we study stationary solutions with suitable boundary data with a view to creating sub and super solutions in the next section. Our stationary solutions satisfy
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:stationary}
L(\xi) = \xi_{rr} + \frac{C}{r} \xi_r - \frac{F'(0)}{r^2} \xi = \frac{1}{r^2} \bar{F}(\xi).
\end{equation}
Writing \(u = \xi, v = \xi_r\) this is equivalent to the system
\[
\begin{pmatrix}
u' \\
v'
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
v \\
\frac{1}{r^2} F(u) - \frac{C}{r} v
\end{pmatrix}.
\]
For each fixed \(r > 0\), the right hand side is a Lipschitz function of \((u,v)\) since \(F\) is Lipschitz, but it is not uniformly Lipschitz in \(r\). The right hand side is also continuous with respect to \(r\) for \(r > 0\) but only measureable for \(r \in [0, 1]\). The Cartheodary theorem \emph{does not} guarantee the existence of an absolutely continuous solution \((u, v)\) on \([0, \rho_1)\) for some  \(\rho_1 > 0\) since the coefficient functions \(1/r\), \(1/r^2\) while measureable, are not integrable. However, below we obtain solutions by explicitly solving the equation.

On the other hand, if we can obtain a solution \(\xi\) on \([0,\rho_1)\) for some \(\rho_1 > 0\), then this solution may be extended uniquely to \(r \in [0, 1]\) by choosing any \(\rho_2 \in (0, \rho_1)\) and solving the uniformly elliptic problem \eqref{eq:stationary} subject to the boundary conditions \(\psi(\rho_2) = \xi(\rho_2)\), \(\psi(1) = \psi_1\) on \([\rho_1, 1]\). Recall \(\psi_1\) is any real number occurring as the boundary data at \(r=1\) in \eqref{eq:pde}. The solution so obtained is uniformly \(C^{2,\alpha}\) on any interval \([\rho_2, 1]\) where \(\rho_2 > 0\) but not generally up to all of \([0, 1]\).

Finally, note that requiring finite energy solutions and imposing the initial condition \(\psi(0) = 0\) will provide us with a one-parameter family of solutions, parametrised by \(\psi'(0)\) with which to construct sub and super solutions for the blow up argument later.

\subsection{Stationary solutions for \(C=1\)}

Let us first consider the case \(C = 1\) which is satisfied in critical dimension. It will be convenient to work directly with \(F\) rather than the linearisation.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:stationaryC1}
For each \(\lambda > 0 \) there exists a \emph{strictly monotone} stationary solution \(\xi_{\lambda}\) (solving \eqref{eq:stationary}) with the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \(\xi_{\lambda} (r) = \lambda r^{\sqrt{F'(0)}} + \bigo(r^{(1+\alpha) \sqrt{F'(0)}}) \text{ as } r \to 0\) and for some \(\epsilon > 0\), \label{itm:stationaryC1_asymptotic}
\item For every \(r > 0\), the pointwise limit, \(\lim_{\lambda \to 0} \xi_{\lambda} (r) = 0\), \label{itm:stationaryC1_lambda_0}
\item For every \(r > 0\), the pointwise limit, \(\lim_{\lambda \to \infty} \xi_{\lambda} (r) = \infty\). \label{itm:stationaryC1_lambda_infty}
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We can solve equation \eqref{eq:stationary} explicitly (in terms of \(F\)) by changing variables, \(y = e^w\) and letting \(\zeta(w) = \xi(e^w)\), whence our problem becomes
\[
\begin{cases}
\zeta'' &= e^{2w} \xi'' + e^w \xi' = F (\zeta) \\
\zeta(-\infty) &= 0.
\end{cases}
\]
Multiplying by \(\zeta'\) this becomes
\[
[(\zeta')^2]' = 2 F (\zeta) \zeta'.
\]
Integrating gives
\[
(\zeta')^2 = G(\zeta) + C_1, \quad \text{where} \quad G'(Z) = 2 F(Z).
\]
By adjusting \(C_1\) if necessary, we may assume that \(G(0) = 0\). Then, referring to definition \ref{defn:energy} and remark \ref{rem:finite_energy}, in order to a obtain finite energy solution we require that
\[
\frac{1}{2} \int_0^1 \left(\psi_r^2 + \frac{1}{r^2} u^2(\psi)\right) r dr < \infty.
\]
For the gradient term, substituting
\[
\psi(r) = \zeta(\ln r)
\]
with \((\zeta')^2 = G(\zeta) + C_1\) we get
\[
\frac{1}{2} \int_0^1 \psi_r^2 r dr  = \frac{1}{2} \int_0^1 \frac{G(\zeta(\ln r^)) + C_1}{r} dr < \infty.
\]
Now if \(C_1 \ne 0\), then since \(\zeta(-\infty) = 0\) and \(G(0) = 0\), by continuity there is an interval \([0, \rho]\) on which \(\abs{G(\zeta(\ln r))} < \abs{C_1}/2\) and consequently
\[
\frac{\abs{G(\zeta(\ln r)) + C_1}}{r} dr \geq \frac{\abs{C_1}}{2} \frac{1}{r}
\]
which is not integrable. Therefore we conclude that \(C_1 = 0\) and in fact,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:G}
G(z) = 2 \int_0^z F (s) ds = \int_0^z (u^2)' (s) ds = u^2 (z).
\end{equation}
In particular, \(G > 0\) on \((0,a)\) and \(G(0) = G(a) = 0\).

Thus we must solve
\[
\frac{\zeta'}{\sqrt{\abs{G(\zeta)}}} = 1
\]
Notice that near \(z = 0\) we have \(F (z) = F'(0) z + \bigo(z^{1+\alpha})\) so that
\[
G'(z) = 2F(z) \Rightarrow G(z) = z^2F'(0) + \bigo(z^{2 + \alpha})
\]
and so
\[
\sqrt{\abs{G(\zeta)}} = z \sqrt{F'(0) + \bigo(z^{\alpha})} = \sqrt{F'(0)} z + \bigo(z^{1 + \alpha})
\]
is continuous (even differentiable) near \(z = 0\). In fact, explicitly,
\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{\abs{G(z)}}} = \frac{1}{u(z)}
\]
is as regular as \(u\) is away from \(0, a\).

Now our solution satisfies
\[
H (\zeta(w)) = w + \mu, \quad \text{where} \quad H'(Z) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\abs{G(Z)}}}.
\]
for an arbitrary constant \(\mu\). Explicitly, choosing any \(a_0 \in (0, a)\) we have
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:H}
H(z) = \int_{a_0}^z \frac{1}{u(s)} ds.
\end{equation}
Varying \(a_0\) just has the effect of varying \(\mu\).

Note that since \(u(z) = \sqrt{F'(0)} z + \bigo(z^{1 + \alpha})\) near \(z=0\) and near \(z=a\), we find that \(1/u\) is not summable near \(z = 0, a\) and hence
\[
H(0) = - \int_0^{a_0} \frac{1}{u(s)} ds = - \infty, \quad H(a) = \int_{a_0}^a \frac{1}{u(s)} ds = \infty.
\]
This is also why we cannot define \(H(z) = \int_{0}^z \frac{1}{u(s)} ds\). More importantly, we have
\[
H'(z) = \frac{1}{u(z)} > 0, \quad z \in (0, a).
\]
Thus \(H\) is strictly increasing and hence a \(C^1\)-diffeomorphism of \((0, a)\) onto \(\R\) so that \(H^{-1}\) is defined and \(C^1\).

In terms of \(\xi(r) = \xi(r) = \zeta(\ln r)\), we have the representation formula
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:stationaryC1}
\xi(r) = H^{-1} (\ln r + \mu) = H^{-1} (\ln \lambda r)
\end{equation}
where \(\lambda = e^{\mu}\). Thus since \(H^{-1}\) maps \(\R\) into \((0, a)\) we have \(0 < \xi(r) < a\) for all \(r \in (0, 1)\) and so our solutions automatically have \(L^{\infty}\) bounds independent of \(\lambda\). We may also use the implicit relation
\[
H (\xi(r)) =  \ln \lambda r.
\]

Either way, we derive:
\begin{align*}
\xi'(r) &= \frac{1}{r}  \sqrt{G(\xi(r))} \\
\xi''(r) &= \frac{1}{r} \frac{G'(\xi(r)) \xi'(r)}{2 \sqrt{G(\xi(r))}} - \frac{1}{r^2} \sqrt{G(\xi(r))} \\
&= \frac{1}{r^2} \left(F(\xi(r))- \sqrt{G(\xi(r))}\right).
\end{align*}
from which we easily verify that \(\xi\) is indeed a solution to equation \eqref{eq:stationary}.

Now we just verify the properties asserted in the statement of the lemma. First, we already observed that \(H^{-1}\) is strictly monotone increasing with \(H^{-1}(-\infty) = 0\) and \(H^{-1}(\infty) = a\). Thus since \(\ln \lambda r\) is also strictly monotone increasing we get that \(\xi = H^{-1} (\ln \lambda r)\) is strictly monotone increasing. We also obtain the last two properties:

Property (\ref{itm:stationaryC1_lambda_0}) follows since for any \(r > 0\),
\[
\lim_{\lambda \to 0} H^{-1}(\ln \lambda r) = H^{-1}(-\infty) = 0.
\]
Property (\ref{itm:stationaryC1_lambda_infty}) follows since for any \(r > 0\),
\[
\lim_{\lambda \to \infty} H^{-1}(\ln \lambda r) = H^{-1}(\infty) = a.
\]

Finally, to verify property (\ref{itm:stationaryC1_asymptotic}), first observe that replacing \(F\) by
\[
\tilde{F} = \frac{1}{F'(0)} F
\]
we have \(\tilde{F}'(0) = 1\). Let us also write \(\tilde{H}^{-1}\) for the corresponding \(H\) in which case
\[
\tilde{\xi}(s) = \tilde{H}^{-1} (\ln \lambda s)
\]
satisfies
\[
\tilde{\xi}_{ss} + \frac{1}{s} \tilde{\xi}_s = \frac{1}{s^2} \tilde{F}(\tilde{\xi}).
\]
Then in fact \(\xi(r) = \tilde{\xi}(r^{\sqrt{F'(0)}})\) since letting \(s = r^{\sqrt{F'(0)}}\) and \(\ell = \sqrt{F'(0)}\), we have
\[
\begin{split}
\xi_{rr} + \frac{1}{r} \xi_r &= \ell^2 r^{2(\ell - 1)} \tilde{\xi}_{ss} + \ell (\ell - 1) r^{\ell - 2} \tilde{\xi}_s + \frac{1}{r} \ell r^{\ell - 1} \tilde{\xi}_s \\
&= \ell^2 r^{-2} \left((r^{\ell})^2\tilde{\xi}_{ss} + r^{\ell} \tilde{\xi}_s\right) = \ell^2 r^{-2} \left(s^2 \tilde{\xi}_{ss} + s \tilde{\xi}_s\right) \\
&= \frac{1}{r^2} F'(0) \tilde{F}(\tilde{\xi}(r^{\ell})) = \frac{1}{r^2} F(\xi).
\end{split}
\]

Thus in fact it suffices to show
\[
\xi_{\lambda} (r) = \lambda r + \bigo(r^{1 + \alpha}) \text{ as } r \to 0
\]
under the assumption \(F'(0) = 1\) (and also relabelling \(\lambda \mapsto \lambda^{1/\sqrt{F'(0)}}\) which doesn't affect the other required properties).

To this end, note that
\[
H(z) = \int \frac{1}{\sqrt{|G(s)|}} ds = \int \frac{ds}{s + \bigo(s^{1+\alpha})} = \int \frac{1}{s}(1 + \bigo(s^{\alpha})) ds = \ln z + \bigo(z^{\alpha}).
\]
Then we have, letting \(z = H^{-1}(w)\),
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:w_asymptotics}
\begin{split}
\abs{H^{-1}(w) - e^w} &= \abs{z - e^{H(z)}} = \abs{z - e^{\ln z + \bigo(z^{\alpha})}} \\
&= \abs{z - e^{\bigo(z^{\alpha})} z} = \abs{(1 - e^{\bigo(z^{\alpha})})z} \\
&\leq A z^{1+\alpha} \\
&= A (H^{-1}(w))^{1+\alpha}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
for some \(A > 0\) and \(z \in [0, \epsilon)\) for some \(\epsilon > 0\), or equivalently for \(w \in (-\infty, M)\) for some \(M\). In particular
\[
\abs{H^{-1}(w) - e^w} \to 0 \text{ as } w \to -\infty
\]
since \(w \to -\infty \Rightarrow z \to 0\) so that there exists a \(W \in \R\) such that
\[
H^{-1}(w) \leq 2 e^w
\]
for \(w \in (-\infty, W)\). Substituting this into equation \eqref{eq:w_asymptotics} gives
\[
\abs{H^{-1}(w) - e^w} \leq 2^{1+\alpha} A e^{(1+\alpha)w}
\]
for \(w \in (-\infty, W)\).

Therefore with \(w = \ln \lambda r\) we obtain
\[
\begin{split}
\abs{\xi(r) - \lambda r} &= \abs{H^{-1} (\ln \lambda r) - e^{\ln \lambda r}} \\
&\leq 2^{1+\alpha} A e^{(1+\alpha)\ln \lambda r} \\
&= 2^{1+\alpha} A \lambda^{1+\alpha} r^{1+\alpha}
\end{split}
\]
provided \(r \in [0, H^{-1}(W))\) as required.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}[Harmonic map heat flow in \(\S^2\)]

Here we have
\[
F(Z) = \frac{\ell^2}{2} \sin(2Z)
\]
so that
\[
G(Z) = \ell^2 \sin^2(Z)
\]
and
\[
H(Z) = -\frac{1}{2\ell} \ln \left(\frac{1+\cos(Z)}{1-\cos(Z)}\right) = \frac{1}{\ell}\ln \left(\tan(Z/2)\right)
\]
with inverse
\[
H^{-1}(W) = \arccos\left(\frac{e^{-2\ell W} - 1}{e^{-2\ell W} + 1}\right) = 2 \arctan(e^{\ell W})
\]
Thus solution is
\[
\xi(r) = H^{-1} (\ln \lambda r) = \arccos\left(\frac{(\lambda r)^{-2\ell} - 1}{(\lambda r)^{-2\ell} + 1}\right) = 2\arctan((\lambda r)^{\ell}).
\]

Up to relabeling \(\lambda^{-\ell} \mapsto \lambda\) this is the function used in \cite{MR1180392} and \cite{MR2332425}.
\end{example}

\subsection{Stationary solutions for arbitrary \(C\)}

In this case, we don't have the same integrability structure as with \(C = 1\). However, we can still solve (somewhat less explicitly) by factoring \(L\) as the composition of two first order differential operators.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:stationaryC}
For each \(\lambda > 0 \) there exists a \emph{strictly monotone} stationary solution \(\xi_{\lambda}\) (solving \eqref{eq:stationary}) with the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \(\xi_{\lambda} (r) = \sqrt{F'(0)} \lambda r^{\beta_+} + \bigo(r^{\beta + \epsilon}) \text{ as } r \to 0\) and for some \(\epsilon > 0\) and where \(\beta_+\) is the positive root of the characteristic equation, \label{itm:stationaryC_asymptotic}
\item For every \(r > 0\), the pointwise limit, \(\lim_{\lambda \to 0} \xi_{\lambda} (r) = 0\), \label{itm:stationaryC_lambda_0}
\item For every \(r > 0\), the pointwise limit, \(\lim_{\lambda \to \infty} \xi_{\lambda} (r) = \infty\). \label{itm:stationaryC_lambda_infty}
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We define
\begin{align*}
L_+ &= \partial_r - \frac{\beta^+ - 1}{r} = r^{\beta_+ - 1} \partial_r (r^{-(\beta_+ - 1)} \cdot) , \\
L_- &= \partial_r - \frac{\beta^-}{r} = r^{\beta_-} \partial_r (r^{-\beta_-} \cdot).
\end{align*}
Since \(\beta^{\pm}\) are the roots of the characteristic equation,
\[
\beta^2 + (C - 1) \beta - F'(0) = 0
\]
we have
\[
- \beta^+ - \beta^- = C-1, \quad \beta^+ \beta^- = -F'(0).
\]
Therefore,
\[
L_+ \circ L_- = \partial_r^2 + \frac{-(\beta_+ - 1) -\beta_1}{r} + \frac{\beta_+ \beta_-}{r^2} = L.
\]

Then our stationary solution satisfies
\[
L_+ \circ L_- \xi = \frac{1}{r^2} \bar{F}(\xi)
\]
or equivalently
\[
\xi = L_-^{-1} \circ L_+^{-1} \left(\frac{1}{r^2} \bar{F}(\xi)\right).
\]
where \(L_-^{-1}, L_+^{-1}\) are any left inverses. Note that \(L_{\pm}\) being first order, linear differential operators have non-unique left inverses, determined up to arbitrary constants \(C_{\pm}\). Explicitly,
\begin{align*}
L_+^{-1} (\varphi) &= r^{\beta_+ - 1} \int r^{-(\beta_+ - 1)} \varphi(r) dr + C_+ r^{\beta_+-1}, \\
L_-^{-1} (\varphi) &= r^{\beta_-} \int r^{-\beta_-} \varphi(r) dr + C_- r^{\beta_-}
\end{align*}
and hence
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:}
\begin{split}
\xi &= r^{\beta_-} \int \left[\rho^{-\beta_-} L_+^{-1} \left(\frac{1}{\rho^2} \bar{F}(\xi)\right)\right] d\rho + C_- r^{\beta_-} \\
&= r^{\beta_-} \int \left[\rho^{-\beta_-} \rho^{\beta_+ - 1} \int \left(\tau^{-(\beta_+ - 1)} \frac{1}{\tau^2} \bar{F}(\xi) \right)d\tau + \rho^{-\beta_-} C_+ \rho^{\beta_+-1}\right] d\rho + C_- r^{\beta_-} \\
&= r^{\beta_-} \int \left[\rho^{\beta_+ - \beta_- - 1} \int \left(\tau^{-(\beta_+ + 1)} \bar{F}(\xi) \right)d\tau\right] d\rho + \frac{C_+}{\beta_+ - \beta_-} r^{\beta_+} + C_- r^{-\beta_-}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Letting
\[
G(\varphi) = r^{\beta_-} \int \left[\rho^{\beta_+ - \beta_- - 1} \int \left(\tau^{-(\beta_+ + 1)} \bar{F}(\varphi) \right)d\tau\right] d\rho
\]
and absorbing \(\tfrac{1}{\beta_+ - \beta_-}\) (recall \(\beta_+ \ne \beta_-\)) into \(C_+\), we have
\[
(\Id - G) (\xi) = C_+ r^{\beta_+} + C_- r^{\beta_-}.
\]

Formally then, we obtain the representation formula,
\[
\xi = (\Id - G)^{-1} \left(C_+ r^{\beta_+} + C_- r^{\beta_-}\right).
\]
Note that in the case \(\bar{F} = 0\) we have \(G = 0\) and as expected, we recover the general solution, \(\xi = C_+ r{\beta_+} + C_- r^{\beta_-}\) to the linearised equation \(L(\xi) = 0\).

\begin{rem}
In the case, \(C = 1\), the characteristic equation is \(p(\beta) = \beta^2 - F'(0) = (\beta - \sqrt{F'(0)})(\beta + \sqrt{F'(0)})\), hence \(\beta_+ = -\beta_- = \sqrt{F'(0)}\) and
\[
L_+ = \partial_r - \frac{\beta_+ - 1}{r}, \quad L_- = \partial_r + \frac{\beta_+}{r}.
\]
It seems this difference of squares structure is what allows for the substitution \(r = e^w\) in the \(C=1\) case described above. Following the discussion there, the reader will observe that integrating to obtain \(\zeta'\) and then integrating again to obtain \(\zeta\) is nothing but factoring \(L\) as the composition of first order operators. It's just that for \(C = 1\), it can be done quite directly after changing variables whereas for the general case, we proceeded slightly less directly. Needless to say, this factoring for \(C = 1\) was the motivation for the general case.

For the sake of completeness, when \(C \ne 1\), the substitution, \(r = (1-C)^{1/(1-C)} w^{1/(1-C)}\) leads to
\[
\zeta'' = \frac{1}{(1-C)^2 w^2} F(\zeta)
\]
which is not so easy to integrate directly, not to mention the complications arising when \(C < 1\) in the coefficient \((1 - C)^{1/(1 - C)}\).
\end{rem}

{\color{red} We now need a contraction mapping to assert the existence of an inverse}.

{\color{red}We also need to determine how the solutions vary with respect to the free parameters which is needed for barrier construction}.

{\color{red}Work out asymptotics as \(r\to 0\) which is important for barrier construction}.
\end{proof}

\section{Blow up}

Recall, our differential equation is
\[
\partial_t \psi = \psi_{rr} + \frac{C}{r} \psi_r - \frac{1}{r^2} F(\psi)
\]
Here we show that for bounded solutions, the phenomena of blow depends only on \(C\) and \(\lim_{z\to 0} z^{-1} F(z)\). Since we assume \(F\) is Lipschitz, we have \(|z^{-1} F(z)|\) is bounded near \(0\) and we now make the further assumption that the limit exists in which case, since \(F(0) = 0\) and \(F\) is odd and increasing,
\[
A = \lim_{z\to 0} z^{-1} F(z) \geq 0.
\]
The model case is if \(F\) is differentiable at \(z=0\), in which case the limit is simply \(A = F'(0)\) and if \(F\) is say \(C^2\) near \(z=0\), then \(F(z) = Az + \mathcal{O} (z^2)\) as \(z \to 0\).

\subsection{Comparison Principle}

Our argument is based on the following comparison principle:

\begin{thm}[Comparison Principle]
\label{thm:comparison}
Let \(\psi\) satisfy equation \eqref{eq:pde} and let \(\overline{\xi}\) be a super-solution; that is
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:pde_super}
\begin{cases}
\partial_t \overline{\xi} &\geq \overline{\xi}_{rr} + \frac{C}{r} \overline{\xi}_r - \frac{1}{r^2} F(\overline{\xi}) \\
\overline{\xi}(r, 0) &\geq \psi_0(r) \\
\overline{\xi}(0, t) &= 0, \quad \overline{\xi}(1, t) \geq \psi_1, \quad t \in [0, T).
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
Then \(\psi \leq \overline{\xi}\) for all \(t \in [0, T)\). If on the other hand, \(\underline{\xi}\) satisfies the conditions of equation \eqref{eq:pde_super}, but with all inequalities reversed, then \(\psi \geq \underline{\xi}\).
\end{thm}

The proof is basically a standard comparison principle, but with a slight adjustment to deal with the singular behaviour of the coefficients \(1/r\) and \(F(\psi(r))/r^2\) near \(r=0\). Note also that the only non-linearity occurs in the lowest order term \(F(\psi(r))/r^2\). These constraints account for the assumptions on \(F\) given in the introduction (see equations \eqref{eq:near_positive} and \eqref{eq:far_positive}).

\begin{proof}
We only prove the super-solution case, \(\overline{\xi}\). The sub-solution case \(\underline{\xi}\) is similar.

Let
\[
\varphi = \psi - \overline{\xi}.
\]
Then the initial assumption is \(\varphi(r, 0) \leq 0\) and the claim of the theorem is that \(\varphi(r, t) \leq 0\) for all \(t \in [0, T)\). As usual we argue by contradiction: If the claim is false, then there is a \(\tau > 0\) such that
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:false_claim}
\sup \{\varphi(r, t) : 0 \leq r \leq 1, 0 \leq t \leq \tau\} > 0.
\end{equation}

Before going through the contradiction argument, we first need to handle the singular coefficients at \(r = 0\). Since \(\psi(0, t) = \overline{\xi}(0, t) = 0\), by the regularity of \(\psi\) and \(\overline{\xi}\), there exists a \(\rho > 0\) such that
\[
-\delta < \psi, \xi < \delta, \quad \text{for} \quad 0 \leq r \leq \rho, \quad 0 \leq t \leq \tau.
\]
By the assumptions \(F(0) = 0\), and \(F\) is odd, increasing on \((-\delta,\delta)\), we must have
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:near_positive}
0 \leq \frac{F(\psi) - F(\overline{\xi})}{\psi - \overline{\xi}}, \quad (r, t) \in [0, \rho] \times [0, \tau].
\end{equation}

Next, to handle \(r\) away from \(\rho\), we choose any \(\lambda\) such that
\[
\lambda > \frac{1}{\rho^2} \operatorname{Lip} (F) > 0
\]
where \(\operatorname{Lip} (F)\) is the Lipschitz constant of \(F\). Then for  \(r \geq \rho\) we have
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:far_positive}
\lambda + \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{F(\psi) - F(\overline{\xi})}{\psi - \overline{\xi}} > \lambda - \frac{1}{r^2} \operatorname{Lip} (F) > 0
\end{equation}

Now we may define
\[
h = e^{-\lambda t} \varphi.
\]
Note that \(\tau\) is already given by assuming the theorem is false in \eqref{eq:false_claim} and is independent of \(\lambda\) which is essential. A lower bound for the constant \(\lambda\) does depend on \(\tau\) through \(\rho\) but we are free to increase \(\lambda\).

We may now apply the usual contradiction argument as follows: The assumptions of the theorem give
\[
h(0, t) \leq 0, \quad h(1, t) \leq 0 \quad \text{and} \quad h(r, 0) \leq 0
\]
while claiming the conclusion of the theorem is false implies, by equation \eqref{eq:false_claim} that
\[
\sup \{h(r, t) : 0 \leq r \leq 1, 0 \leq t \leq \tau\} > 0.
\]
Let \((r_0, t_0) \in (0, 1) \times (0, \tau]\) realise the supremum. Then at \((r_0, t_0)\) we have
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:max_principle_inequality}
\begin{split}
\partial_t h &= - \lambda e^{-\lambda t} \varphi + e^{-\lambda t} \partial_t \varphi \\
&\leq  -\lambda e^{-\lambda t} \varphi + e^{-\lambda t} \left[\psi_{rr} + \frac{C}{r} \psi_r - \frac{1}{r^2} F(\psi)\right] \\
&\quad - e^{-\lambda t}\left[\overline{\xi}_{rr} + \frac{C}{r} \overline{\xi}_r - \frac{1}{r^2} F(\overline{\xi})\right] \\
&= h_{rr} + \frac{C}{r} h_r - \left(\lambda + \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{F(\psi) - F(\overline{\xi})}{\psi - \overline{\xi}}\right) h.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Moreover, \(h(r_0, t_0)\) equals the supremum which is assumed positive, hence by equation \eqref{eq:max_principle_inequality},
\[
\lambda + \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{F(\psi) - F(\overline{\xi})}{\psi - \overline{\xi}} \leq \frac{1}{h} \left(h_{rr} + \frac{C}{r} h_r - \partial_t h\right) \leq 0.
\]
But this gives a contradiction since using equation \eqref{eq:near_positive} for \(r_0 \leq \rho\), and equation \eqref{eq:far_positive} for \(r_0 \geq \rho\) gives
\[
\lambda + \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{F(\psi) - F(\overline{\xi})}{\psi - \overline{\xi}} > 0.
\]
\end{proof}

\subsection{Blow up at the origin}
\label{subsec:origin_blowup}

With our heuristic motivation to hand, we move on to show that blow up of bounded solutions, if it occurs at all, must occur at the origin. This is a straight forward application of standard estimates \cite[Theorem 10.1]{Ladyzhenskaja:/1967} but we record the details in the following lemma for convenience.

{\color{red} Might need to clarify norms here. They probably should be spatial norms and we take a sup over t. Also $L^{\infty}$ bounds might follow from parabolic theory and bounds on the initial data.}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:apriori_bounds}
Let \(\psi\) be a solution of \eqref{eq:pde} with initial data \(\psi_0\) satisfying
\[
\|\psi_0\|_{C^{2,\alpha}([0, 1])} < \infty,
\]
and
\[
\|\psi\|_{L^{\infty} ([0, 1] \times [0, \tau])} < \infty
\]
If there exists a \(\rho \in (0, 1]\) and a \(\tau \in (0, T)\) such that
\[
\|\psi\|_{C^{2,\alpha}([0, \rho] \times [0, \tau])} < \infty,
\]
then
\[
\|\psi\|_{C^{2,\alpha}([0, 1] \times [0, \tau])} < \infty.
\]
In particular, if the maximal existence time \(T < \infty\), then
\[
\lim_{\tau\to T} \inf_{\rho \in (0, 1)} \{\|\psi\|_{C^2([0, \rho] \times [0, \tau])}\} = \infty.
\]
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We need to show
\[
\|\psi\|_{C^{2,\alpha}([\rho, 1] \times [0, \tau])} < \infty,
\]
under the hypothesis
\[
\|\psi\|_{C^{2,\alpha}([0, \rho] \times [0, \tau])} < \infty.
\]

We use the notation of \cite[Theorem 10.1]{Ladyzhenskaja:/1967}. Define the linear operator
\[
\mathcal{L} \psi = \partial_t \psi - \psi_{rr} - \frac{C}{r} \psi_r
\]
and
\[
f(r, t) = -\frac{1}{r^2} F(\psi(r, t))
\]
so that
\[
\mathcal{L} \psi = f.
\]

Let \(\Omega = (0, 1)\), \(\Omega' = (\rho, 1)\), and \(\Omega'' = (\rho/2, 1)\), \(S = \{0, 1\}\), \(S' = S'' = \{1\}\). \cite[Theorem 10.1]{Ladyzhenskaja:/1967} gives constants \(c_1, c_2 > 0\) such that
\[
\begin{split}
\|\psi\|_{C^{2,\alpha}([\rho, 1] \times [0, \tau])} &\leq c_1 \left(\|\tfrac{1}{r^2} F(\psi)\|_{C^{0,\alpha}([\rho/2, 1] \times [0, \tau])} + \|\psi_0\|_{C^{2,\alpha}([\rho/2, 1])} + \|\psi\|_{C^{2,\alpha}(\{1\} \times [0, \tau])} \right) \\
&\quad + c_2 \|\psi\|_{C([\rho/2, 1] \times [0, \tau])}.
\end{split}
\]

In the hypothesis of the theorem, we assume \(\psi\) has finite \(C^{0,\alpha}\) norm, hence the last term is finite. Since \(F\) is also Lipschitz, the first term \(r^{-2} F(\psi(r, t))\) has finite \(C^{0,\alpha}\) norm on \(r \in [\rho, 1], t \in [0, \tau]\). The second term is the initial data \(\psi_0\) which is assumed to have finite \(C^{2,\alpha}\) norm and finally the third term - the boundary term \(\psi|_{r=1}\) - is constant hence also has finite norm.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Criteria for blow up}

The following lemma, simply combines what we have obtained so far into a criteria for blow up depending on the existence of suitable barriers.

\begin{lemma}[Blow up criteria]
\label{lem:blowup_criteria}
Let \(\psi\) solve the equivariant harmonic map heat flow, equation \eqref{eq:pde} on \([0, 1] \times [0, T)\). Then  we have the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\item If there exists a sub-solution \(\xi\) to equation \eqref{eq:pde} such that \(\xi(r, t=0) \leq \psi(r, t=0)\) and \(\xi'(0, t) \to \infty\) as \(t \to T\), then \(\psi'(0, t) \to \infty\) as \(t \to T\). Likewise, if \(\psi(r, t = 0) \leq \xi(r, t=0)\) for a super-solution with \(\xi'(0, t) \to -\infty\) as \(t \to T\), then \(\psi'(0, t) \to \infty\) as \(t \to T\). \label{itm:blowup}
\item If there exists a super-solution \(\xi\) to equation \eqref{eq:pde} such that \(-\xi(r, t=0) \leq \psi(r, t=0) \leq \xi(r, t-0)\) with \(\abs{\xi} \leq M_1\) and \(\abs{\xi'(0, t)} \leq M_2 < \infty\) for \(t \in [0, T)\) and some \(M_1, M_2 > 0\) then there exists an \(N\) with \(0 < N < \infty\) such that \(\|\psi(\cdot, t)\|_{C^{1,\alpha}} \leq N\) for all \(t \in [0, T)\). \label{itm:noblowup}
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Proof of \ref{itm:blowup}:

We just prove the sub-solution and blow up to \(\infty\) case, the super-solution and blow up to \(-\infty\) being identical and in fact following by replacing \(\xi\) with \(-\xi\).

By the comparison principle \Cref{thm:comparison}, \(\psi(r, t) \geq \xi(r, t)\) for all \(r \in [0, 1]\) and \(t \in [0, T)\). Since \(\psi(0, t) = \xi(0, t)\) we then must have \(\psi'(0, t) \geq \xi'(0, t) \to \infty\) as \(t \to T\).

Proof of \ref{itm:noblowup}:

Just as with the previous case the comparison principle \Cref{thm:comparison} gives \(-\xi(r, t) \leq \psi(r, t) \leq \xi(r, t)\) for all \(r \in [0, 1]\) and \(t \in [0, T)\) and hence \(\abs{\psi(r, t)} \leq M_1\) and \(-M_2 \leq -\xi'(0, t) \leq \psi'(0, t) \leq \xi'(0, t) \leq M_1\). Thus for any \(\tau \in [0, T)\) we have a \(\rho_0 > 0\) with
\[
\|\psi(\cdot, t)\|_{C^{1,\alpha}([0, \rho_0])} \leq 2M_2.
\]
for all \(t \in [0, \tau]\). Then \Cref{lem:apriori_bounds} ensures that
\[
\|\psi(\cdot, t)\|_{C^{1,\alpha}([0, 1])} < N
\]
for all \(t \in [0, \tau]\) with \(N\) depending only on the local \(C^1\) bound \(M_2\), the initial data and the \(C^0\) bound \(M_1\).
\end{proof}

\begin{rem}
In the case \ref{itm:noblowup}, if \(T < \infty\), then we have uniform \(C^{1,\alpha}\) bounds on \([0, T)\) and thus the solution extends past \(T\). In particular, if \(\xi\) is defined on all \([0, \infty)\) with the same assumptions as in the lemma, then no finite time blow up can occur.
\end{rem}

\section{Barriers}
\label{subsec:barriers}

Now we may construct barriers from the stationary solutions given in \Cref{lem:stationaryC1,lem:stationaryC} to which we apply the blow up criteria \Cref{lem:blowup_criteria} to characterise whether blow up occurs or not.

\subsection{The case \(\|\psi\|_{\infty} < a, C=1, \sqrt{F'(0)} > 1, \psi_0 = \bigo(r^{\sqrt{F'(0)}})\)}

This is the simplest case, and we can just use the stationary solution from \Cref{lem:stationaryC1} as a barrier. Recall that \(\xi_{\lambda} (r) = \sqrt{F'(0)} \lambda r^{\beta_+} + \bigo(r^{\beta + \epsilon})\) and \(\lim_{\lambda \to \infty} \xi_{\lambda} (r) = \infty\). Thus we may choose \(\lambda\) large enough such that \(\xi_{\lambda}(r) \geq \psi_0(r)\). Then since \(\xi\) is a stationary solution, it is in particular a super solution hence \Cref{lem:blowup_criteria} applies to rule out finite time blow up. 

\subsection{The case \(\|\psi\|_{\infty} < 2a\)}.

In this case, we add together two stationary solutions \(\xi_{\lambda}\) and \(\xi_{\mu}\), allowing \(\lambda\) to depend on \(t\). That is,
\[
\xi(r) = \xi_{\lambda(t)} + \xi_{\mu}
\]
where \(\lambda\) will be chosen to ensure we get sub/super solutions as appropriate, and \(\mu > 0\) is a constant. The function \(\lambda(t)\) will have some constants \(A > 0, \lambda_0 > 0\), and we'll choose \(\mu, \lambda_0\) to get the initial inequality and \(A\) to obtain a sub/super solution.

The key thing is to understand the non-linear term \(F(u)\). In particular the second order part. Recall we have
\[
F(Z) = F'(0) Z + \bar{F}(Z)
\]
where
\[
\bar{F}'(0) = 0, \quad \lim_{r\to 0} \frac{1}{Z} \bar{F}(Z) = 0, \quad \lim_{Z\to 0} \frac{\abs{\bar{F}(Z)}}{Z^{1+\alpha}} < \infty.
\]

Our harmonic map heat flow equation is
\[
\partial_t \psi = L(\psi) - \frac{1}{r^2} \bar{F}(\psi)
\]
and stationary solutions satisfy
\[
L(\psi) = \frac{1}{r^2} \bar{F}(\psi).
\]

Our candiate barrier, \(\xi(r) = \xi_{\lambda(t)} + \xi_{\mu}\) satisfies
\[
\partial_t \xi = \partial_{\lambda} \xi_{\lambda} \partial_t \lambda
\]
and
\[
\begin{split}
L(\psi) - \frac{1}{r^2} F(\psi) &= L(\xi_{\lambda} + \xi_{\mu}) - \frac{1}{r^2} \bar{F}(\xi_{\lambda} + \xi_{\mu}) \\
&= L(\xi_{\lambda}) + L(\xi_{\mu}) - \frac{1}{r^2} \bar{F}(\xi_{\lambda} + \xi_{\mu}) \\
&= \frac{1}{r^2}\left[\bar{F}(\xi_{\lambda}) + \bar{F}(\xi_{\mu}) - \bar{F}(\xi_{\lambda} + \xi_{\mu})\right].
\end{split}
\]

Thus we obtain a sub solution if and only if
\[
\partial_{\lambda} \xi_{\lambda} \partial_t \lambda \leq \frac{1}{r^2}\left[F_2(\xi_{\lambda}) + F_2(\xi_{\mu}) - F_2(\xi_{\lambda} + \xi_{\mu})\right]
\]
and a super solution if and only if we have \(\geq\) instead.

{\color{red}Again, the barrier should be a sub-solution that blows up for \(0 < F'(0) \leq 1\)  and a super solution that does not blow up for \(1 < F'(0)\).}


\subsection{The case \(C=1, \sqrt{F'(0)} > 1, \psi_0 = \bigo(r^{\sqrt{F'(0)}})\)}

Choose \(A\) with \(0 < A < \frac{a}{\|\psi_0\|_{\infty}}\) so that
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:scaled_Linfty}
0 \leq \abs{A \psi_0} < a
\end{equation}
Our comparison function is then
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:comparisonC1}
\eta(r, t) = \frac{1}{A} \xi_{\lambda_0 e^{Kt}} (r)
\end{equation}
for constants \(\lambda_0, K > 0\) to be chosen below. To apply the blowup criteria, \Cref{lem:blowup_criteria}, we need to show initial inequality and that \(\eta\) is a super solution. For convenience, let us write \(\lambda(t) = \lambda_0 e^{Kt}\) which satisfies \(\lambda(0) = \lambda_0\).

For the initial inequality, recall from \Cref{lem:stationaryC1} that
\[
\xi_{\lambda} (r) = \sqrt{F'(0)} \lambda r^{\beta_+} + \bigo(r^{\beta + \epsilon}) \text{ and } \lim_{\lambda \to \infty} \xi_{\lambda} (r) = a.
\]
By assumption \(\psi_0 = \bigo(r^{\sqrt{F'(0)}})\) as \(r \to 0\), and as in \Cref{rem:char_eqn_C1}, for \(C=1\) we have \(\beta_+ = \sqrt{F'(0)}\). Then we can choose \(\lambda_0 > 0\) sufficiently large so that
\[
\abs{A \psi_0} \leq \xi_{\lambda_0}.
\]

This follows easily since on some interval \([0, \rho]\) with \(\rho > 0\) there exists a \(B > 0\) such that
\[
\abs{\psi_0} \leq B r^{\beta_+}.
\]
Then for any \(\lambda_0 > \sqrt{F'(0)}^{-1} B A\) we have
\[
\abs{A \psi_0} \leq \xi_{\lambda_0}
\]
on some interval \([0, \bar{\rho}]\) with \(0 < \bar{\rho} \leq \rho\). On \([\bar{\rho}, 1]\), \(\xi_{\lambda_0} \to a\) uniformly as \(\lambda_0 \to \infty\) so by equation \eqref{eq:scaled_Linfty}, increasing \(\lambda_0\) if necessary we may also ensure that \(\abs{A \psi_0} \leq \xi_{\lambda_0}\) on \([\bar{\rho}, 1]\).

Thus there exists \(A, \lambda_0 > 0\) such that the function \(\eta = \tfrac{1}{A} \xi_{\lambda}\) defined in equation \eqref{eq:comparisonC1} satisfies the initial inequality,
\[
-\eta \leq \psi_0 \leq \eta.
\]

Next we prove \(\eta\) is a super-solution. That is,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:supersolutionC1}
\partial_t \eta = \frac{K}{A} \lambda \partial_{\lambda} \xi_{\lambda} \geq L(\eta) - \frac{1}{r^2} \bar{F}(\eta) = \frac{1}{r^2} \left[\frac{1}{A} \bar{F}(\xi_{\lambda}) - \bar{F}\left(\tfrac{1}{A} \xi_{\lambda}\right)\right]
\end{equation}
where we use that \(\xi_{\lambda}\) is stationary hence,
\[
L(\xi_{\lambda}) = \frac{1}{r^2} \bar{F}(\xi_{\lambda}).
\]

Now note that
\[
\lambda \partial_{\lambda} \xi_{\lambda} = \lambda \partial_{\lambda} [H^{-1}(\ln \lambda r^{\beta_+})] = \lambda \frac{1}{H'(H^{-1} (\ln \lambda r^{\beta_+}))} \frac{1}{\lambda} = u(\xi_{\lambda})
\]
using equation \eqref{eq:stationaryC1} defining \(\xi_{\lambda}\) and equation \eqref{eq:H} giving \(H' = u^{-1}\) from \Cref{lem:stationaryC1}. Substituting and simplifying a little, equation \eqref{eq:supersolutionC1} then reduces to
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:supersolutionC1K}
K \geq = \frac{\bar{F}(\xi_{\lambda}) - A \bar{F}\left(\tfrac{1}{A} \xi_{\lambda}\right)}{r^{2}u(\xi_{\lambda})}
\end{equation}

Now \(\bar{F}(z) = F(z) - \sqrt{F'(0)} z\) is bounded and \(u > 0\) for \(z \in (0, a)\). Furthermore, \(\xi_{\lambda}\) is strictly increasing with \(\xi_{\lambda}(0) = 0\) so that for any \(\rho>0\), \(0 < \xi_{\lambda}(\rho) \leq \xi_{\lambda}(r) \leq a\) on \(r \in [\rho, 1]\). Thus \(u(\xi_{\lambda} (r))\) is bounded below on \([\rho, 1]\) and so too is \(r^{2}\). Then we define
\[
K(\rho) = \frac{\bar{F}(\xi_{\lambda}) - A \bar{F}\left(\tfrac{1}{A} \xi_{\lambda}\right)}{r^{2}u(\xi_{\lambda})} < \infty
\]
so that equation \eqref{eq:supersolutionC1K} is satisfied on \([\rho, 1]\) for any \(K \geq K(\rho)\).

To finish we then need to also show that
\[
\sup_{r \in (0, \rho]} \frac{\bar{F}(\xi_{\lambda}) - A \bar{F}\left(\tfrac{1}{A} \xi_{\lambda}\right)}{r^{2}u(\xi_{\lambda})} < \infty
\]
or equivalently,
\[
\limsup_{r\to 0} \frac{\bar{F}(\xi_{\lambda}) - A \bar{F}\left(\tfrac{1}{A} \xi_{\lambda}\right)}{r^{2}u(\xi_{\lambda})} < \infty.
\]
For this we recall the asymptotics as \(z \to 0\) of \(\bar{F}\) and \(u\) described in the proof of \Cref{lem:stationaryC1}:
\[
\bar{F}(z) = \bigo(z^{1+\alpha}), \quad u(z) = \sqrt{G(z)} = \sqrt{F'(0)} z + \bigo(z^{1+\alpha})
\]
along with the asymptotics of \(\xi_{\lambda}\) from \Cref{lem:stationaryC1}:
\[
\xi_{\lambda} (r) = \sqrt{F'(0)} \lambda r^{\beta_+} + \bigo(r^{\beta_+ + \epsilon})
\]
as \(r \to 0\). Let \(B > 0\) denote the constant such that
\[
\abs{\bar{F}(z)} \leq B z^{1+\alpha}
\]
for sufficiently small \(z\). Then for \(r\) sufficiently small,
\[
\begin{split}
\abs{\frac{\bar{F}(\xi_{\lambda}) - A \bar{F}\left(\tfrac{1}{A} \xi_{\lambda}\right)}{r^{2}u(\xi_{\lambda})}} &\leq \frac{B \sqrt{F'(0)}^{1+\alpha} \lambda^{1+\alpha} r^{(1+\alpha)\beta_+} + \bigo(r^{(1+\alpha)(\beta_+ + \epsilon)})}{\lambda F'(0) r^{\beta_+ + 2} + \bigo(r^{\beta_+ + 2 + \epsilon})} \\
&\leq \bar{B} \lambda^{\alpha} r^{\alpha\beta_+ - 2}
\end{split}
\]
for another constant \(\bar{B} > 0\).

{\color{red} Then a little care is needed since \(\lambda^{\alpha} = \lambda_0^{\alpha} e^{\alpha Kt} \to \infty\) as \(t \to \infty\) so we can't get a bound that works for all \(t\). There's some balancing needed because we want to choose \(K\) bigger than this bound, but the quantity to be bounded includes \(K\) in the exponential. Probably best to got back and not specify \(\lambda\) as the exponential and keep all the \(\lambda\)'s around until now and then determine what it should be. Then, assuming that is okay, we would have \eqref{eq:supersolutionC1K} satisfied on \([0, \rho]\) (for \(\rho > 0\) sufficiently small) whenever
\[
\beta_+ \geq \frac{2}{\alpha}.
\]
This seems somewhat problematic, since we already know that for the harmonic map heat flow \(D^2 \to \S^2\), \(\alpha = 2\) and \(\beta_+ = \frac{2}{\alpha} = 1\) blows up! contradicting what we seem to be getting here.
